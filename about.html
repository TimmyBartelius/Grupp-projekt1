          At Pear, we are transforming the world of virtual reality with cutting-edge VR headsets designed to bring
          digital worlds to life.
        </h1>

        <div>
          <p>
            Pear was born in a small garage, founded by a group of passionate tech enthusiasts who shared one goal: to
            create a new standard in virtual reality. Frustrated by the limits of existing technology, we began our
            journey by blending our skills in software, hardware, and design to develop a product that was both powerful
            and user-friendly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is simple: to make high-quality virtual reality experiences accessible to everyone. From
            immersive gaming and professional simulations to groundbreaking educational tools, Pear’s VR headsets push
            the boundaries of what's possible.
